Setting up
==========

Things are pretty simple. `home/` contains the dotfiles, `bootstrap` is a
shell script that rips out corresponding dotfiles and replaces them with
symlinks. The symlinking assumes that this repository was checked out to
`~/dotfiles`. I may add more customizability if it turns out to be helpful.
